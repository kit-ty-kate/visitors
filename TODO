TODO

Allow the user to specify how to deal with (parameterized) nonlocal type constructors.
  Must allow a local "open" to take place before invoking nonlocal function.
    let open! VisitorsRuntime in let open! <user's choice> in <nonlocal function call>
  Must allow user to derive several "iter"-like classes under different names.

Allow the user to choose exactly which visitors they want generated.

Test on the Frama-C AST.

Try the system with hash-consed terms. (With/without binding.)

Document everything.
  Document the names that could be captured:
    Pervasives
    Failure

Avoid warnings about unused variables.

Deal with abstract types just as if they were nonlocal.

Think about compositionality.
  By multiple inheritance?

Think about transforming a closed recursive type definition into an open one.
