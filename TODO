TODO

Perhaps support inline notation ("core_type")
  by treating every type constructor as nonlocal?

Perhaps do something about ~path,
  which seems connected to nested modules.

Test on the Frama-C AST.

Try the system with hash-consed terms. (With/without binding.)

Document everything.
  The name [VisitorsRuntime] must not be shadowed.

Avoid warnings about unused variables.

Deal with abstract types just as if they were nonlocal.

Think about compositionality.
  By multiple inheritance?

Think about transforming a closed recursive type definition into an open one.

Show to François Bobot and Virgile Prevosto. Try the Frama-C AST.
Show to Andrei and Jean-Christophe.
