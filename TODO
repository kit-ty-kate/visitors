TODO

Document everything.

Modify ClassFieldStore.generate to avoid producing multiple declarations
of a virtual method.

Maybe iter and map should not inherit from visitor; the user could mix
  them by herself.

Move all of the naming conventions that could clash to a single place.
Check that no clashes are possible.

Deal with parameterized type definitions.
  Both local and nonlocal.

Reproduce everything at arity 2 (visitor2, iter2, map2).

Think about compositionality.
  By multiple inheritance?

Think about transforming a closed recursive type definition into an open one.

Show to François Bobot and Virgile Prevosto. Try the Frama-C AST.

Add a LICENSE. Announce.

BUGS

The tuple trick of always reconstructing a tuple may not work as desired?
It may force the user to also reconstruct a tuple when implementing his own
folds.

If A.t and B.t are nonlocal types, then we need two virtual methods named t.
