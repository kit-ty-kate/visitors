TODO

Allow the user to specify how to deal with (parameterized) nonlocal type constructors.
  Must allow a local "open" to take place before invoking nonlocal function.
    let open! VisitorsRuntime in let open! <user's choice> in <nonlocal function call>
  Must allow user to derive several "iter"-like classes under different names.

Allow the user to choose exactly which visitors they want generated.

Perhaps support inline notation ("core_type")
  by treating every type constructor as nonlocal?

Test on the Frama-C AST.

Try the system with hash-consed terms. (With/without binding.)

Document everything.
  The name [VisitorsRuntime] must not be shadowed.

Avoid warnings about unused variables.

Deal with abstract types just as if they were nonlocal.

Think about compositionality.
  By multiple inheritance?

Think about transforming a closed recursive type definition into an open one.

Show to François Bobot and Virgile Prevosto. Try the Frama-C AST.
Show to Andrei and Jean-Christophe.
