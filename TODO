TODO (REALLY)

Avoid generating beta-redexes.
  (fun (x, y) -> ...) z should be let (x, y) = z in ...

Benchmark.
  Compare the speed of visitor-based code w.r.t. a recursive function.

Test on the Frama-C AST.
  Instantiate visit_'term and visit_'locs and make sure we have working code.

Develop support for names and binders.
  Try to make it a functor, i.e., independent of the structure of terms.
  Do we need private methods?

Try the system with hash-consed terms.
  (With/without binding.)
  Seems to require the ability of deferring visitor generation!

Try dealing with an open term definition and closing it afterwards.
Try dealing with suspended substitutions.
  (As a distinct construct. Not necessarily at abstractions.)

Document everything.
  The name [VisitorsRuntime] must not be shadowed.

Show to François Bobot and Virgile Prevosto.
Show to Andrei and Jean-Christophe.
Add a LICENSE.
Create an opam package. Dependency on 4.03.
  Dependencies on other packages for tests: hashcons, core_bench...
  Run these tests only if these packages are installed, warn otherwise?
Announce.

TODO (PERHAPS)

Generate a "fold" class in addition to iter and map?
  Should not be difficult.
  Create virtual methods for local types. Use external functions for nonlocal types.
    Do something about tuples. (Reconstruct them identically?)
  Analogous to ppx_tools/genlifter.
  Would allow the user to define subclasses, possibly in several steps. Could be useful.

Do something about ~path?
  It seems connected to nested modules.

Think about automatically transforming a closed recursive type definition into an open one.
