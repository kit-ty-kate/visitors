TODO (REALLY)

Re-think the treatment of nonlocal types.
  Add [virtual] option to force [virtual] status, which cannot be guessed.
  Disallow [final] as soon as [ancestors] is nonempty? (It is always!) Remove [final] altogether?
  No need for [path] anymore. (Could still be convenient, though?)
  Implement all necessary classes in [VisitorsRuntime].
  Maybe remove [freeze]?

Use private methods in some (hand-written) classes,
  including VisitorsRuntime and certain kits?

Develop a real test suite, with expected output.
  Check for left-to-right traversal order.

Benchmark.
  Compare the speed of visitor-based code w.r.t. a recursive function.

Test on the Frama-C AST.
  Instantiate visit_'term and visit_'locs and make sure we have working code.

Develop support for names and binders.
  Try to make it a functor, i.e., independent of the structure of terms.
  Do we need private methods?

Try dealing with binding and hash-consing at the same time.

Try dealing with suspended substitutions.
  (As a distinct construct. Not necessarily at abstractions.)

Use explicit loops in VisitorsRuntime.Array.
Remove the old module structure in VisitorsRuntime?

Document everything.
  The name [VisitorsRuntime] must not be shadowed.

Show to François Bobot and Virgile Prevosto.
Show to Andrei and Jean-Christophe.
Add a LICENSE.
Create an opam package. Dependency on 4.03. Note @@unboxed requires 4.04.
  Dependencies on other packages for tests: hashcons, core_bench...
  Run these tests only if these packages are installed, warn otherwise?
Announce.

TODO (PERHAPS)

Implement a way of deferring visitor generation.
  (inserting user code between the type definition and the visitor class)

Generate a variant of "iter" with an explicit accumulator?
  Would allow getting rid of mutable variables in user code.

Generate a generic (bottom-up) "fold" class?
  Create virtual build_ methods for local types.
  Use external functions for nonlocal types.
  Do something about tuples. (Reconstruct them identically?)
  Analogous to ppx_tools/genlifter.
  Would allow the user to define subclasses, possibly in several steps. Could be useful.

Avoid generating beta-redexes.
  (fun (x, y) -> ...) z should be let (x, y) = z in ...

Do something about ~path?
  It seems connected to nested modules.

Think about automatically transforming a closed recursive type definition into an open one.
