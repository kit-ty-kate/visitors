2017/03/17:
New attributes [@build] and [@@build] can be attached to record type
declarations and data constructors, so as to alter the construction code that
is used in map, endo, and mapreduce visitors. See the documentation for
details. (This feature was suggested by Reuben Rowe.)

2017/03/15:
New attributes [@name] and [@@name] can be attached to types, type declarations,
and data constructors, so as to alter the names of the generated methods. See
the documentation for details. (This feature was suggested by Reuben Rowe.)

2017/03/08:
A new option [polymorphic = true] allows generating visitor methods with
polymorphic types. With [polymorphic = true], a type variable ['a] is
handled by a visitor *function* [visit_'a], which is passed as an argument
to every visitor method; whereas, with [polymorphic = false], a type
variable ['a] is handled by a virtual visitor *method* [visit_'a].
With [polymorphic = true], visitor classes compose better,
and irregular algebraic data types are supported.
See the documentation for more details.
(This feature was suggested by Reuben Rowe.)

2017/03/03:
A new option [data = false] allows suppressing the generation of visitor
methods for data constructors. This makes the generated visitor slightly
simpler and faster, but less customizable.

A new option [nude = true] allows *not* implicitly inheriting the class
VisitorsRuntime.<variety>.

2017/02/15:
Makefile.preprocess is now installed with the package, so users can rely on it
without needing to copy it. See the documentation for instructions.

2017/02/13:
Added a new variety of visitors, "mapreduce". This visitor computes a pair of a
data structure (like a "map" visitor) and a summary (like a "reduce" visitor).
This can be used to annotate every tree node with information about the
subtree that lies below it. See the documentation for an example.

2017/02/09:
Documentation: added a new subsection on OCaml objects,
entitled "Where the expressiveness of OCaml's type system falls short".
This section explains why "map" cannot be a subclass of "fold",
even though it should be.

2017/01/31:
Documentation: added an example of constructing a lexicographic ordering.
Documentation: discussed generating visitors for existing types and ppx_import.

2017/01/26:
Initial release.
