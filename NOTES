When the arguments of a data constructor are arranged in an inline record, we
would ideally like the data constructor's descending method to receive named
arguments. E.g., it could receive a record as an argument. But that does not
work, because we would need to declare a record type, with the same fields.
Or, it could take labeled arguments. That would work, I think, but we prefer
to avoid labels. Our solution, for now, is to pass unnamed arguments to the
descending method. The arguments appear in the same order as in the data
constructor declaration.
